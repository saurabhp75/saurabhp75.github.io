## Vector features:

### Points:

Points geometry: A point feature is described by its X, Y and optionally Z coordinate.
Point attributes: id, name description
Example: 2, Tree, outside our classroom

### Lines:

Polyline geometry: A polyline is a sequence of joined vertices. Each vertex has an X, Y (and optionally Z) coordinate.
Example: 2, Footpath 2, Ferom the school gate to the hall.

### Polygons:

A Polygon like a polyline, it is a sequence of vertices. However in a polygon, the first and last vertices are always at the same position.

exporting csv file as shapefile:

select features of a layer:

save selected features as shape file.
